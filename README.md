The 2.0 release of my weapons variety mod has finally released, now with even more guns! Tired of raiders showing up with the same old autopistol? Want a realistic gun mod with a little more "style"? Don't care about so called "Bloat? Then GTek has a supply of used, surplus sporting rifles with your name on it!

The calibers being listed in the screenshots is for CE users, but it also shows a good idea of how much damage they do. Note that certain weapons may appear too small or too large, as this was made with CE in mind which has its own weapon rendering system.

Potentially Asked Questions:

Q: Why can't I craft x weapon?
A: In order to cut down on taking up menu space, certain weapons which are simply cosmetic variants of the same gun or have extremely similar stats can only be found through trade or used by raiders. This also applies to civilian (semi-auto) variants of guns, weapons which simply would be extremely overpowered if they could be crafted for low cost, or weapons which aren't particularly useful in combat but could be fun to collect and spice up the typical raider loadout. With Vanilla Expanded Framework installed, you can remove these restrictions and make any gun you want by visiting the mod settings.

Q: Combat Extended Compatible?
A: Hell yeah it is.

Q: Why do my guns look weird?
A: Since this mod was made with Combat Extended in mind, certain weapons use CE's expanded rendering features to allow large guns to fit correctly on the colonist's shoulder. However, since vanilla doesn't have this feature this can cause certain guns (mostly very large ones) to look awkward when held. See last screenshot for examples.

Q: What happened to the melee weapons in the older version?
A: Since the melee side of the mod was mostly neglected, I decided to scrap them and save them for a separate release dedicated to melee. Expect to see it release, someday.

Q: Why did you decide to make this?
A: I only really made this mod so that pirate raids show up with more than just the same revolver every single time, and because for some reason every gun mod I've seen has that one gun that is super rare and exotic in real life with only like 0.5 of them made and in-game they show up in every raid. Plus, I've just noticed a strange lack of mods with guns that normal people actually use day-to-day. Instead, it's mostly military weapons and obscure prototypes, which I do love every once in a while, but I'm honestly just more interested in weapons I can legally own, which is why there's a larger emphasis on pistols and AR-15s here than any other workshop mod.

Q: May I make a suggestion?
A: Sure thing, though I have a very specific taste in firearms so don't feel too bad if it's not something I'm interested in.
